\chapter{Overview}
The Katana Native Interface KNI is an open source software library for controlling the Katana robot. KNI is written in C++ and structured so that it can easily be ported to other languages and frameworks. The code is non-platform-specific and can be compiled under both Windows (with the MS Visual C++ Compiler) and Linux (with the GNU Compiler Toolchain).\newline

Since the KNI abstracts the underlying layers, applications can be written for the Katana without having to become involved in the details of the system. It takes just a few function calls to connect and initialise the robot. The protocol for controlling the robot from the PC is abstracted in its entirety. The KNI features an implementation of robot kinematics and path calculation routines for the synchronous control of all axes and the traversing of paths in space with the end effector.\newline

The openness of the common sources also makes the KNI the ideal tool for research and training, since the entire implementation can be traced, as well as modified and adapted at will.
