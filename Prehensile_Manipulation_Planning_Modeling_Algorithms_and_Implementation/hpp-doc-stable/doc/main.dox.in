\par Introduction

HPP (Humanoid Path Planner) is a collection of software packages
implementing path planning functionalities for a humanoid robot.
The core functionalities are well suited to solve classical path planning problems.
It can be extended to path planning for other types of robots like digital actors for instance.

\par Installation

Installation instructions can be found on
<a target="_blank" href="https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc/download.html">github</a>.

\par Overview of the architecture

The code relative to HPP is distributed into several software
packages. See \ref hpp_doc_dependency_graph "dependency graph" for a quick
view of the package hierarchy.

The packages are distributed into the following categories:
\li \ref hpp_doc_algorithms "Algorithms" implementing path planning functionalities
\li \ref hpp_doc_corba_interface "Corba" communication facilities to control algorithms
\li \ref hpp_doc_graphical_interface "Graphical user interface" to display configurations and paths.

    The algorithmic part, built on @hpp-core_LINK@ is
    embedded in corba servers implemented by
    @hpp-corbaserver_LINK@ or extensions like
    @hpp-manipulation-corba_LINK@.
    The corba servers are linked to executable \c hppcorbaserver.
    <p></p>
    From a python terminal, clients to the corba servers can be created in order
    to control the executable. The control of the application is performed via
    idl interfaces and python classes available in \ref hpp_doc_corba_interface.
    <p></p>
    Results of path planning requests as well as individual configurations can
    be displayed in \c gepetto-gui via package
    @hpp-gepetto-viewer_LINK@.

\par Getting started

Package @hpp_tutorial_LINK@ provides some examples of
how to use this project.
