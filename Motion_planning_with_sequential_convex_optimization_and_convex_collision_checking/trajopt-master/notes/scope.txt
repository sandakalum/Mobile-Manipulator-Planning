What types of problems does trajopt aim to handle

- articulated robot that's a a kinematic chain or tree
- 6dof navigation, e.g. helicopter
- mimic joints (e.g. pr2 gripper)
- configuration space that's made of two robots
- configuration space on arbitrary manifold, where there are different global and local coordinates

I should make some test problems for all of these cases
