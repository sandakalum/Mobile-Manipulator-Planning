Add methods in Var class so we don't need to say var.var_rep everywhere

Add unit tests for solver interface

Linear vs nonlinear costs

Improve SQP algorithm performance in infeasible-start case

Make index compression more efficient

When you're removing convexconstraints, don't need to update until the end

Select solver intelligently (bpmpd vs gurobi) 

Add unit tests for solver interface

Linear vs nonlinear costs

Improve SQP algorithm performance in infeasible-start case

Allow constraints to be added as equality constraints, not hinge

Perhaps move complementarity stuff in here
