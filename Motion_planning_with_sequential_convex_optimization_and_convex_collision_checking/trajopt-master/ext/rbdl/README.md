RBDL - Rigid Body Dynamics Library
Copyright (c) 2011-2013 Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

Introduction
============

The RBDL is a highly efficient C++ library that contains some essential
rigid body dynamics algorithms such as the Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA)
for forward dynamics, Newton-Euler Algorithm for inverse dynamics and the
Composite Rigid Body Algorithm (CRBA) for the efficient computation of
the joint space inertia matrix. It further contains code for forward and
inverse kinematics and handling of external constraints such as contacts
and collisions.

The code was written by Martin Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>
and tightly follows the notation used in Roy Featherstone''s book "Rigid
Body Dynamics Algorithm".

 *  24 January 2012: implemented compact and fast representation of RigidBodyDynamics::Math::SpatialTransform

Documentation
=============

The documentation is contained in the code and can be extracted with the
tool [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org).

To create the documentation simply run

    doxygen Doxyfile

which will generate the documentation in the subdirectory ./doc/html. The
main page will then be located in ./doc/html/index.html.

An online version of the generated documentation can be found at
[http://rbdl.bitbucket.org](http://rbdl.bitbucket.org).

Getting RBDL
============

The latest stable code can be obtained from

    https://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl/get/default.zip

The official mercurial repository can be cloned from

    https://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl

(See [http://mercurial.selenic.com/](http://mercurial.selenic.com) for

Building and Installation
=========================

The RBDL is built using CMake (http://www.cmake.org). To compile the
library in a separate directory in Release mode use:

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ../ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

Licensing
=========

The library is published under the very permissive zlib free software
license which should allow you to use the software wherever you need.
