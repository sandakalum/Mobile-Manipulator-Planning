This is a highly inefficient math library. It was conceived by Martin
Felis <martin.felis@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de> while he was waiting for code to
compile which used a highly efficient math library.

It is intended to be used as a fast compiling substitute for the
blazingly fast Eigen3 http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
library and tries to mimic its API to a certain extent.

Feel free to use it wherever you like. However, no guarantees are given
that this code does what it says it would.
